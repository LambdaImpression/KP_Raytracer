# Ray Tracers: Golang and CUDA Versions

This repository contains two implementations of a ray tracer:
- A **Golang ray tracer** in the `ray_tracer_go_v2` folder.
- A **CUDA ray tracer** in the `ray_tracer_cuda` folder.

Both ray tracers render scenes defined in JSON files and allow for flexible configuration via command-line arguments. The programs also include default scenes showcasing various materials and objects.

---

## Features
- Supports rendering 3D scenes described in JSON files.
- Parallel processing for optimized performance:
    - **Golang ray tracer**: Multithreading via goroutines.
    - **CUDA ray tracer**: GPU-based parallelism with adjustable blocks and threads.
- Command-line arguments for customizable output.
- Built-in testing frameworks for verifying components.

## Program Structure

### Golang Ray Tracer
The Golang ray tracer (`ray_tracer_go_v2`) is structured into modules that handle:
- **JSON parsing**: Reads and interprets the scene description.
- **Ray generation**: Constructs rays from a virtual camera.
- **Object interaction**: Computes intersections between rays and objects.
- **Material handling**: Applies material properties for realistic lighting.
- **Image creation**: Outputs rendered images as `.ppm` files.

### CUDA Ray Tracer
The CUDA ray tracer (`ray_tracer_cuda`) is implemented in C++ with CUDA for GPU acceleration. Key modules include:
- **Camera**: Manages the virtual viewpoint and ray directions.
- **Scene objects**: Sphere-based primitives with materials.
- **Ray-object intersection**: Computes collisions using GPU threads.
- **Material rendering**: Simulates lighting and reflections.
- **Parallelism**: Configurable via CUDA blocks and threads.

## Diagrams

### Class Diagram

The following class diagram provides an overview of the architecture of the CUDA-based ray tracer. It shows the relationships between core components, such as the **camera**, **rays**, **materials**, **objects**, and the rendering pipeline.

![Class Diagram](./docs/class_diagram.svg)

#### Key Highlights:
1. **Namespaces**:
    - The codebase is modularized into the following namespaces:
        - **`calc`**: Utility classes for 3D vector and mathematical operations.
        - **`emit`**: Classes for rays and the camera.
        - **`mat`**: Abstract `material` class and its concrete implementations (`lambertian`, `metal`, `dielectric`).
        - **`canvas`**: Core ray-tracing abstractions, including `intersectable`, `renderer`, and `image`.
        - **`objects`**: Defines renderable objects like `sphere`.

2. **Core Components**:
    - **`emit::camera`**:
        - Generates rays for each pixel in the image.
    - **`emit::ray`**:
        - Represents rays in the scene and their attributes (origin and direction).
    - **`mat::material`** and its Subclasses:
        - Handle how objects interact with light, including scattering, reflection, and refraction.
    - **`canvas::intersectable`**:
        - Abstract base class for objects that can be intersected by rays.
        - Implemented by `objects::sphere` and `canvas::hitlist`.
    - **`canvas::renderer`**:
        - Manages the rendering process, including creating the world, tracing rays, and generating the final image.

3. **Configuration**:
    - **`sphere_config`**:
        - Provides configuration for sphere objects loaded from JSON files.

4. **Relationships**:
    - **Inheritance**:
        - `objects::sphere` and `canvas::hitlist` inherit from `canvas::intersectable`.
        - `lambertian`, `metal`, and `dielectric` inherit from `mat::material`.
    - **Dependencies**:
        - The `renderer` interacts with the `camera`, `intersectable`, and `material` components to render the scene.

#### Note on the Golang Implementation:
The Golang version of the ray tracer is structurally similar to the CUDA implementation. Most core abstractions and relationships remain unchanged, though they are implemented using Goâ€™s standard library and concurrency model. Since the architecture closely mirrors the CUDA version, this class diagram is representative of both implementations.
